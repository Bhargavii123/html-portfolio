        <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
        <p>It's a combination of thriller and mystery with the chosen one! My all time favorite movie. [My father will hear about this Potteh!]</p>
        <h3>Stranger Things</h3>
        <p>It conatains Mystery and Horror, definitely exciting and kept me on my toes.</p>
        <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
        <p>Its a great anime but spoiler alert Gojo dies at the end.</p>
